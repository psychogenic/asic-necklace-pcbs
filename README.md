# ASIC Necklace PCBs

Schems and PCBs for Matt's awesome ASIC necklace, in collaboration with Adam Zeloof.

## Modules

The necklace is comprised of 5 modules:

   * The tip: hosting the Caravel ASIC and driving everything
   * The angled and straight bottom PCBs: hosting the addressable LEDs and forming the links in the circuit chain; and
   * The angled and straight top PCBs: decorative elements and window for LED
   

The circuitry is very basic, as this is just a (pretty expensive, hah) LED chain in the end.
